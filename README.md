# mqttForEjabberd
Hi, I plan make any middle layer between Raw data from internet and Ejabberd.

there will be 2 part of this.
First, Lets Ejabberd can run Mqtt base 2.1.10 & 13.X, 
# dont ask me why, I was work with ejabberd 2.1.10, and that services still running.
there will have 2 step, 
1. a module of Mqtt protocol parser and translate to XMPP let it work in Ejabberd.
2. add MQTT protocol option for ejabberd.

secondly, translate all of exist ejabberd service to support MQTT.



Coming Soon, bro.

any suggestion & question can left to me.
